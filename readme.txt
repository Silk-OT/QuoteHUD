Thank you for downloading QuoteHud.

	How to install
------------------------------
1. Place the quotehud folder inside the zip file into tf/custom
2. If you want to install my crosshair with its custom animations,
   then simply take the 'quotehud' folder inside the crosshair folder 
   and place that into tf/custom as well, making sure to allow any files 
   it asks to be overwritten.

If there are any bugs, contact me via either method below:
My steam quotestrife
bsky @quotesilk.bsky.social

If your damage numbers are red, put this in autoexec.cfg
hud_combattext_red 255
hud_combattext_green 255
hud_combattext_blue 255

Bonus:
if you want a netgraph that displays advanced network settings in the scoreboard, add this to your autoexec.cfg
alias +pinger "+score; net_graph 1"
alias -pinger "-score; net_graph 0"
bind "TAB" "+pinger"
