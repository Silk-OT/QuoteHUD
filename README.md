# QuoteHUD

Based off the abandoned BearHUD (a fork of broeselhud_blue), QuoteHUD takes a modern spin on the TF2 heads up display whilst attempting to remain true to the game's cartoony roots.

This HUD is what very likely got me accepted into college so as thanks, please feel rest assured that this HUD will remain up to date regardless of how many (or how little) ValvE updates their IP.


## Additional information

BTW if you want CC in your language replace the closedcaption_english .txt and .dat files in QuoteHud\Resource with the language of your choice, which can be found here (https://github.com/QyenidQuartz/Team-Fortress-2-Closed-Captions).

If for whatever reason you wish to contact me please do it either by Bluesky (quotesilk@bsky.social) or through Steam. DMs and friend requests will be accepted.
